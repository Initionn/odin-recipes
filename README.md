# odin-recipes
First project on https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes.

In this project I will be creating a website that's a basic version of a recipe website. It will help solidify my basic html abilities and ensure I'm able to execute the most basic commands from memory. It's worth noting that README files don't need the 50 character per line, as the readme will wrap itself the same way VSCode does, so there's no point in worrying about that here. Better to focus on doing that in the commits.

Also testing if adding lines in the README works the way you would expect it would.
